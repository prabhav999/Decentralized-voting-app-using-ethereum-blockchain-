# **Decentralized Voting App Using Ethereum Blockchain**

*This project implements a decentralized voting system on the Ethereum blockchain, where users can vote for candidates in a transparent, immutable, and secure manner. The app utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of the voting process and web3 technologies to interact with the Ethereum blockchain*

 The system is built with the following components:

Ethereum Smart Contract (Solidity): The contract manages candidates and voting logic.
Web3.js: Used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.
Truffle Framework: Provides an environment to compile, deploy, and test Ethereum smart contracts.
Ganache: A local Ethereum blockchain for testing purposes.
The system prevents double voting, ensures that voting data is tamper-proof, and ensures that users can trust the results.

Technologies Used
Solidity: For smart contract development.
Web3.js: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
Truffle: For compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
Ganache: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
npm & Node.js: For managing JavaScript packages and running the app.
Java: For interacting with the smart contract on the backend using web3j.


Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (for JavaScript dependencies)
Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain)
Truffle (for compiling and deploying smart contracts)
Java 18+ (for backend integration using web3j)
Maven (for Java project management)
